Certainly! Point 1 focuses on conducting a user experience evaluation of your tool, which aims to assess how users interact with and perceive your tool in terms of usability, design, and overall satisfaction. Below is a more detailed guideline on how to conduct this evaluation:

User Experience Evaluation Guideline:

1. Define Your Objectives:

Clearly define the objectives of your evaluation. What specific aspects of the user experience do you want to assess? Examples include usability, learnability, efficiency, and user satisfaction.
2. Recruit Participants:

Identify and recruit participants who represent your target audience. These could be musicians, music enthusiasts, or individuals interested in learning to play musical instruments.
3. Prepare Materials:

Prepare the necessary materials for the evaluation, including any instructions for participants, questionnaires, and tasks or scenarios they should complete while using your tool.
4. Usability Testing:

Conduct usability testing sessions where participants interact with your tool while performing specific tasks. Tasks may include:
Searching for a song on Spotify and accessing chord information.
Changing settings or preferences within the tool.
Navigating through the chord progression of a song.
Providing feedback on chord accuracy or completeness.
5. Collect Data:

During usability testing, collect both quantitative and qualitative data. You can use the following methods:
Observations: Note how participants interact with the tool, including any difficulties they encounter.
Think-Aloud: Encourage participants to vocalize their thought process while using the tool.
Surveys or Questionnaires: Administer post-test surveys to gather participant feedback and ratings on aspects like usability, ease of use, and satisfaction.
6. Analyze Data:

Analyze the data collected from your usability testing sessions and surveys. Look for patterns, common issues, and user feedback. Quantitative data can be analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative data can be analyzed thematically.
7. Identify Usability Issues:

Identify specific usability issues or areas where participants encountered difficulties. Prioritize these issues based on their impact on the user experience.
8. Iterative Design:

Use the feedback and insights gathered from the evaluation to make improvements to your tool. This may involve redesigning certain aspects of the user interface, enhancing features, or addressing usability issues.
9. Re-Evaluation (Optional):

If you make significant changes to your tool, consider conducting a follow-up evaluation to assess the impact of these changes on user experience.
10. Report Findings:

In your bachelor's thesis, report the findings of the user experience evaluation. Discuss both the strengths and weaknesses of your tool based on user feedback. Provide recommendations for improvements.
11. Conclusion:

Conclude your evaluation by summarizing the key takeaways and discussing the implications of your findings for the design and usability of your tool.
Remember that the goal of a user experience evaluation is to gather valuable insights that can inform the refinement and enhancement of your tool. It's essential to approach the evaluation process with an open mind and a focus on improving the user experience.
